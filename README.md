# applicationsDB

## Motivation
While utilizing a variety of job board websites to submit my applications for work, I realized that I was double applying to the same positions from different sites!  I decided to build myself a solution to document my applications as I've submitted them.

I'd never combined SQLite with Python so I decided to give it a shot. It ended up being extremely simple!

## Future enhancements
* I'd like to add a GUI to make it more user friendly.
* Expand on the RDBMS and include some notes in another table. 
* Make main an executable.
* Encrypt my db so I don't have to worry about pushing it

#### A note about the committed 'applied.db'
It's just got two dummy entries in it, but you can clear it and build it yourself! (see schema at the head of 'main.py')
